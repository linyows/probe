This file records what those notes cannot carry well: changes that break code
importing probe as a library.

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

Helpers that do not depend on the workflow engine moved out of the root
`probe` package into packages of their own. No aliases are left behind, so
code that imports them has to be updated as follows.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `probe.MatchJSON` | `jsonutil.Match` |
| `probe.DiffJSON` | `jsonutil.Diff` |
| `probe.ParseJSON` | `jsonutil.Parse` |
| `probe.Masker` | `mask.Masker` |
| `probe.NewMasker` | `mask.New` |
| `probe.TruncateString` | `truncate.String` |
| `probe.TruncateMapStringString` | `truncate.MapString` |
| `probe.TruncateMapStringAny` | `truncate.Map` |
| `probe.GetTruncationMessage` | `truncate.Message` |
| `probe.MaxLogStringLength` | `truncate.MaxLogLength` |
| `probe.MaxStringLength` | `truncate.MaxLength` |

`Printer.SetMasker`, `Printer.Masker`, `Report.Mask` and `RunOptions.Masker`
now take or return a `*mask.Masker`.

The packages are imported from `github.com/linyows/probe/jsonutil`,
`github.com/linyows/probe/mask` and `github.com/linyows/probe/truncate`. Two
more new packages, `safefile` and `procgroup`, hold what used to be
unexported in the root package.
