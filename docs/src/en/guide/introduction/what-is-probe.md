# What is Probe?

Probe is a free, open-source tool that allows you to declaratively define workflows in YAML. It operates as a lightweight, single binary without requiring complex installation or configuration.

## What Can It Do?

Probe can be utilized for the following purposes:

- **API Testing**: Automated end-to-end testing of REST APIs
- **Website Monitoring**: Monitoring site uptime and performance
- **Health Checks**: System and service health verification
- **Data Processing**: Periodic data retrieval and transformation
- **Notification Sending**: Automated notifications to email, Slack, etc.
- **Task Automation**: Automation of repetitive tasks

## Key Features

Here are the five main features that make Probe the preferred choice.

### Simple and Intuitive
Create workflows easily with YAML-based configuration, no programming knowledge required.

### Lightweight and Fast
Developed in Go as a single binary, runs without dependencies.

### Extensible
Plugin-based architecture allows easy addition of custom actions.

### Concurrent Execution
Efficiently processes workflows by running multiple jobs in parallel.

### Rich Features
Equipped with practical features including conditional branching, data sharing, error handling, and environment variable support.

## Simple Workflow Examples

Let's understand how to use Probe through actual code examples.

### Basic Hello World Workflow

Let's start with the simplest example. Create the following YAML file:

```yaml
name: Hello World Workflow

jobs:
- name: My First Job
  steps:
  - name: Say Hello
    uses: hello
    wait: 1s
    echo: "Hello, World!"
```

Save this workflow to a file and run it:

```bash
$ probe hello-world.yml
Hello World Workflow

⏺ My First Job (Completed in 1.04s)
  ⎿  0. ▲  1s → Say Hello
           Hello, World!

Total workflow time: 1.07s ✔︎ All jobs succeeded
```

### More Practical Example: API Monitoring

Here's a real-world example of a workflow that monitors API uptime:

```yaml
name: API Health Check

defaults:
  http:
    url: https://httpbin.org

jobs:
- name: Monitor API Health
  steps:
  - name: Check Homepage
    uses: http
    with:
      get: /status/200
    test: res.status == 200

  - name: Check API Response
    uses: http
    with:
      get: /json
    test: res.status == 200 && res.json != null
```

As you can see, Probe enables you to create and execute workflows in a **simple**, **quick**, and **enjoyable** way.

## Available Actions

Probe comes with the following built-in actions that you can use immediately. Here are the currently available actions and future development plans.

### HTTP Action

- Configurable working directory and environment variables
- Retrieve exit codes, stdout, and stderr
- Control execution time with timeout settings

### Browser Action
Control Chrome using Chrome DevTools Protocol.
- Automate page loading, element clicking, text input, etc.
- Screenshot capture functionality
- Wait for element visibility/invisibility
- Choose between headless and full browser modes

### Embedded Job Action
Simplify workflow management by sharing and reusing jobs.
- Call jobs defined in other workflows
- Parameter passing capabilities
- Split and reuse complex workflows
- Efficient workflow design based on DRY principles

### Database Action
Perform database operations.
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
- Execute SQL operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- **gRPC Action** - Communication with gRPC services
- **FTP Action** - File transfer with FTP servers
- **IMAP Action** - Email reception and processing
:::

### Custom Actions

When built-in actions don't meet your requirements, you can develop custom actions as **plugins**. They can be implemented in Go and seamlessly integrate into Probe's architecture.
