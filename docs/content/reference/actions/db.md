# Database Action

The `db` action executes SQL queries on MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases, providing comprehensive result handling and error reporting.

## Basic Syntax

A database step gives the connection string and the statement to run.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Database Query"
    uses: db
    with:
      dsn: "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"
      query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = ?"
      params: [true]
    test: res.code == 0 && res.rows_affected > 0
```

## Parameters

A database step is described by four parameters: where to connect, what to run, the values to bind, and how long to wait.

### `dsn` (required)

**Type:** String  
**Description:** Database connection string with automatic driver detection  
**Supports:** Template expressions

```yaml
# MySQL
vars:
  db_pass: "{{DB_PASS}}"

with:
  dsn: "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"
  dsn: "mysql://{{vars.db_user}}:{{vars.db_pass}}@{{vars.db_host}}/{{vars.db_name}}"

# PostgreSQL
vars:
  pg_user: "{{PG_USER}}"
  pg_pass: "{{PG_PASS}}"
  pg_host: "{{PG_HOST}}"
  pg_db: "{{PG_DB}}"

with:
  dsn: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable"
  dsn: "postgres://{{vars.pg_user}}:{{vars.pg_pass}}@{{vars.pg_host}}/{{vars.pg_db}}"

# SQLite
with:
  dsn: "file:./testdata/sqlite.db"
  dsn: "file:/absolute/path/to/database.db"
  dsn: "file:{{vars.data_dir}}/app.db"
```

### `query` (required)

**Type:** String  
**Description:** SQL query to execute  
**Supports:** Template expressions and multi-line strings

```yaml
with:
  query: "SELECT * FROM users"
  query: "INSERT INTO logs (message, timestamp) VALUES (?, NOW())"
  query: |
    SELECT u.name, u.email, p.title 
    FROM users u 
    JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id 
    WHERE u.active = ? AND u.created_at > ?
```

### `params` (optional)

**Type:** Array of mixed values (String, Number, Boolean)  
**Description:** Query parameters for prepared statements  
**Supports:** Template expressions

```yaml
with:
  query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ? AND active = ?"
  params: [123, true, "{{vars.user_email}}"]
```

### `timeout` (optional)

**Type:** Duration  
**Default:** `30s`  
**Description:** Time limit for connecting and running the query. A Go duration such as `"60s"`, or a number of seconds; it must be above zero

```yaml
with:
  query: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table"
  timeout: "60s"
```

A query that runs out of time is stopped, and the step goes on to its test with `res.code` set to `1` and `res.error` starting with `timed out after 60s`.

## Response Object

The database action provides a `res` object with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `code` | Integer | Operation result (0 = success, 1 = error) |
| `rows_affected` | Integer | Number of rows affected by the query |
| `rows` | Array | Query results for SELECT statements (as objects) |
| `error` | String | Error message if operation failed |

Besides `res`, the step can test these:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | Integer | `0` when the query succeeds |
| `rt.duration` | String | How long the query took, such as `"1.3ms"` |
| `rt.sec` | Float | The same in seconds |

## Response Examples

What the response holds depends on the statement. A `SELECT` returns rows; an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` returns counts instead.

### SELECT Query Response

Rows come back in `res.rows`, and the count of them in `res.rows_affected`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Fetch Users"
    id: fetch_users
    uses: db
    with:
      dsn: "mysql://user:pass@localhost/db"
      query: "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = ?"
      params: [true]
    test: res.code == 0 && res.rows_affected > 0
    outputs:
      user_count: res.rows_affected
      first_user_id: res.rows[0].id
      first_user_name: res.rows[0].name
```

### INSERT/UPDATE Query Response

A write returns no rows, so the result is in the count of rows it changed.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Insert User"
    uses: db
    with:
      dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"
      query: "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)"
      params: ["John Doe", "john@example.com"]
    test: res.code == 0 && res.rows_affected == 1
```

## Database-Specific Features

The `dsn` and `query` parameters are the same for every driver, but the syntax inside the query is not. The examples below show what each supported database adds.

### MySQL Examples

Connection options go in the DSN, and stored procedures are called like any other statement.

```yaml
# MySQL with connection options
- name: "MySQL Query"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "mysql://user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/database?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=true"
    query: "SELECT VERSION() as mysql_version, NOW() as current_time"
  test: res.code == 0

# MySQL stored procedure
- name: "Call Procedure"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/database"
    query: "CALL GetUsersByDepartment(?)"
    params: ["Engineering"]
  test: res.code == 0
```

### PostgreSQL Examples

PostgreSQL adds JSON and array operators that can be used directly in the query.

```yaml
# PostgreSQL with JSON operations
- name: "JSON Query"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable"
    query: |
      SELECT name, data->>'role' as role, data->'preferences' as prefs
      FROM users 
      WHERE data ? 'role' AND data->>'role' = $1
    params: ["admin"]
  test: res.code == 0

# PostgreSQL array operations
- name: "Array Query"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/database"
    query: "SELECT name FROM users WHERE tags && $1"
    params: ['{"admin","moderator"}']
  test: res.code == 0
```

### SQLite Examples

SQLite takes a file path, or `:memory:` for a database that lasts only as long as the step.

```yaml
# SQLite with file creation
- name: "SQLite Query"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "file:./testdata/sqlite.db"
    query: |
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        email TEXT UNIQUE,
        created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      )
  test: res.code == 0

# SQLite with in-memory database
- name: "Memory Database"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "file::memory:"
    query: "CREATE TABLE temp_data (id INTEGER, value TEXT)"
  test: res.code == 0
```

## Common Query Patterns

Database steps in a workflow tend to do one of three things: assert that the data is in the state it should be, watch how the database itself is behaving, or write a batch of records for later steps to read.

### Data Validation Queries

A query that counts what should not exist turns an invariant into a test.

```yaml
- name: "Check Data Integrity"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "mysql://user:pass@localhost/db"
    query: |
      SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_users,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN active = 1 THEN 1 END) as active_users,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN email IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_emails
      FROM users
  test: |
    res.code == 0 && 
    res.rows[0].total_users > 0 &&
    res.rows[0].missing_emails == 0
```

### Performance Monitoring

The database's own statistics tables report connections and slow queries.

```yaml
- name: "Database Performance Check"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"
    query: |
      SELECT 
        schemaname, 
        tablename, 
        seq_scan, 
        seq_tup_read, 
        idx_scan, 
        idx_tup_fetch
      FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
      WHERE seq_scan > 1000
    timeout: "10s"
  test: res.code == 0
  outputs:
    high_seq_scan_tables: res.rows_affected
```

### Batch Operations

Inserting several rows in one statement prepares the data that later steps read.

```yaml
- name: "Batch Insert"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "mysql://user:pass@localhost/db"
    query: |
      INSERT INTO audit_log (action, table_name, record_id, timestamp) VALUES
      ('CREATE', 'users', 123, NOW()),
      ('UPDATE', 'profiles', 456, NOW()),
      ('DELETE', 'sessions', 789, NOW())
  test: res.code == 0 && res.rows_affected == 3
```

## Security Features

The database action implements several security measures:

- **Prepared Statements**: All parameterized queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Connection String Masking**: Passwords are masked in logs and output
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents long-running queries from hanging
- **Driver Validation**: Only supports approved database drivers
- **DSN Validation**: Validates connection string format before execution

## Under a Guard

Run with `--read-only`, the action runs only one statement that starts with `SELECT`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `DESC`, `EXPLAIN` or `WITH`, and refuses any other statement, or more than one, before connecting. It runs that statement in a read-only transaction, or on a SQLite connection that only queries, so that the database itself refuses a write the statement hides, such as `WITH x AS (DELETE ...) SELECT ...`; that step fails as the database reports it. Run with `--allow-host`, it refuses a DSN whose host the run does not allow, taking a DSN without a port at the driver's port; a SQLite file names no host. A refused step fails with the kind `refused`. See [`--read-only`](/reference/cli-reference#--read-only).

## Error Handling

A query the database rejects, or a connection that fails, does not stop the step: `res.code` is `1` and the database's message is in `res.error`, so the test can check for the failure it expects. The message depends on the database; SQLite reports a missing table as `no such table`.

```yaml
- name: "Query a Table That Does Not Exist"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "file:./testdata/app.db"
    query: "SELECT * FROM missing_table"
  test: res.code == 1 && res.error contains "no such table"
  outputs:
    error: res.error
```

## Transaction Examples

While the action doesn't directly support transactions, you can use database-specific transaction syntax:

```yaml
# PostgreSQL transaction
- name: "Begin Transaction"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"
    query: "BEGIN"
  test: res.code == 0

- name: "Insert Data"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"
    query: "INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ($1)"
    params: ["Test User"]
  test: res.code == 0

- name: "Commit Transaction"
  uses: db
  with:
    dsn: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"
    query: "COMMIT"
  test: res.code == 0
```
