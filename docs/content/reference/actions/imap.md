# IMAP Action

The `imap` action connects to IMAP servers to perform email operations such as reading messages, searching, and mailbox management.

## Basic Syntax

An IMAP step opens a connection and then runs the commands listed in `commands`.

```yaml
vars:
  imap_username: "{{IMAP_USERNAME}}"
  imap_password: "{{IMAP_PASSWORD}}"

steps:
  - name: "Check Email"
    uses: imap
    with:
      host: "imap.example.com"
      port: 993
      username: "{{vars.imap_username}}"
      password: "{{vars.imap_password}}"
      tls: true
      commands:
      - name: "select"
        mailbox: "INBOX"
      - name: "search"
        criteria:
          not_flags: ["seen"]
    test: res.code == 0
```

## Parameters

The parameters describe the server to reach, the credentials to present, how the connection is secured, and the list of IMAP commands to run once it is open.

### `host` (required)

**Type:** String  
**Description:** IMAP server hostname or IP address  
**Supports:** Template expressions

```yaml
with:
  host: "imap.gmail.com"
  host: "imap.example.com" 
  host: "{{vars.imap_server}}"
```

### `port` (optional)

**Type:** Integer  
**Default:** `993`  
**Description:** IMAP server port

```yaml
with:
  port: 993   # IMAPS (SSL/TLS)
  port: 143   # IMAP without TLS (tls: false)
```

### `username` (required)

**Type:** String  
**Description:** IMAP authentication username  
**Supports:** Template expressions

```yaml
vars:
  email_user: "{{EMAIL_USER}}"

with:
  username: "{{vars.email_user}}"
  username: "user@example.com"
```

### `password` (required)

**Type:** String  
**Description:** IMAP authentication password  
**Supports:** Template expressions

```yaml
vars:
  email_password: "{{EMAIL_PASSWORD}}"
  app_password: "{{EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD}}"

with:
  password: "{{vars.email_password}}"
  password: "{{vars.app_password}}"
```

### `tls` (optional)

**Type:** Boolean  
**Default:** `true`  
**Description:** Whether to use TLS/SSL encryption

```yaml
with:
  host: "imap.example.com"
  port: 993
  tls: true     # Use TLS (recommended)

with:
  host: "imap.example.com" 
  port: 143
  tls: false    # Plain connection (not recommended)
```

STARTTLS is not supported: with `tls: false` the whole session, the password included, is sent unencrypted.

### `insecure_skip_tls` (optional)

**Type:** Boolean  
**Default:** `false`  
**Description:** Accept the server's certificate without verifying it

With `tls: true` the certificate is verified against the system's trusted authorities, so a server with a self-signed certificate, such as a local or staging mail server, fails with `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`. `insecure_skip_tls: true` connects anyway. The connection is still encrypted, but it is no longer protected against an impostor, so use it only for servers you control.

```yaml
with:
  host: "mail.staging.internal"
  port: 993
  tls: true
  insecure_skip_tls: true
```

### `timeout` (optional)

**Type:** Duration string or number of seconds  
**Default:** `30s`  
**Description:** Limit for the whole session: connecting, the TLS handshake, logging in, every command and logging out

```yaml
with:
  timeout: "60s"   # or 60
```

A server that does not answer in time is cut off, and the step fails with an action error, which exits the run with status `3`, such as `IMAP session timed out after 30s while running commands`. That is unlike a command the server refuses, which sets `res.code` to `1`. A value that is not a duration, not a number, or not above zero is rejected.

### `commands` (required)

**Type:** Array of command objects  
**Description:** IMAP commands to execute sequentially

The commands run in order in one session. The first command that fails stops the rest: `res.code` becomes `1`, `res.error` names the command, and `res.data` keeps what the commands before it returned.

Each command object takes these fields; which of them a command reads is described with the command below.

| Field | Used by |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Every command (required): the command to run, case-insensitive |
| `mailbox` | `select`, `examine`, `copy`, `uid copy`, `create`, `delete`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe` |
| `oldmailbox`, `newmailbox` | `rename` |
| `reference`, `pattern` | `list` |
| `criteria` | `search`, `uid search` |
| `sequence` | `fetch`, `uid fetch`, `store`, `uid store`, `copy`, `uid copy` |
| `dataitem` | `fetch`, `uid fetch`, `store`, `uid store` |
| `value` | `store`, `uid store` |

```yaml
with:
  commands:
  - name: "select"
    mailbox: "INBOX"
  - name: "search"
    criteria:
      since: "today"
  - name: "fetch"
    sequence: "1:5"
    dataitem: "ALL"
```

## IMAP Commands

Each entry in `commands` names one IMAP operation and carries the fields that operation needs. The commands below are the ones the action understands.

### `select` - Select Mailbox

Select a mailbox for read-write operations.

```yaml
- name: "select"
  mailbox: "INBOX"      # Required: mailbox name
- name: "select" 
  mailbox: "Sent"
- name: "select"
  mailbox: "INBOX/Work"
```

### `examine` - Read-only Mailbox Access

Select a mailbox for read-only operations.

```yaml
- name: "examine"
  mailbox: "INBOX"      # Required: mailbox name
```

### `search` and `uid search` - Search Messages

Search the selected mailbox. `search` returns sequence numbers and `uid search` returns UIDs; both put the result in `res.data.search`, so a later search replaces an earlier one there. The result is also what a following `fetch`, `store` or `copy` without `sequence` acts on, as described under each of them.

```yaml
- name: "search"
  criteria:
    since: "today"           # Arrived today or later
    not_flags: ["seen"]      # Not read yet
    headers:                 # Header fields containing the text
      from: "sender@example.com"
      subject: "urgent"
    bodies: ["important"]    # Body containing the text
    texts: ["meeting"]       # Headers or body containing the text
```

Every criterion given has to match. The criteria are:

| Criterion | Type | Matches messages |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| `seq_nums` | Array of strings | With these sequence numbers, such as `"2:3"`, `"5"` or `"10:*"` |
| `uids` | Array of strings | With these UIDs, in the same form |
| `since` | Date | That arrived on or after the date |
| `before` | Date | That arrived before the date |
| `sent_since` | Date | Whose `Date` header is on or after the date |
| `sent_before` | Date | Whose `Date` header is before the date |
| `headers` | Object | Whose header field, the key, contains the value |
| `bodies` | Array of strings | Whose body contains every string |
| `texts` | Array of strings | Whose headers or body contain every string |
| `flags` | Array of strings | That have every flag |
| `not_flags` | Array of strings | That have none of the flags |

A flag is given without its backslash, as in `seen`, `answered`, `flagged`, `deleted`, `draft` or `recent`, or with it, as in `'\Seen'`. Any other name is a keyword, such as `$Important`, and is passed as it is. There is no `unseen` flag: unread messages are `not_flags: ["seen"]`.

A date is one of:

- `today` or `yesterday`, from midnight in the local time zone of the machine running probe
- `N hours ago` or `N minutes ago`, such as `2 hours ago`
- `2006-01-02`, `2006/01/02`, `02/01/2006` (day first) or `02-Jan-2006`
- RFC 3339, such as `2006-01-02T15:04:05+09:00`, or RFC 822, such as `02 Jan 06 15:04 JST`

IMAP compares dates without the time, so only the day of a date counts: `2 hours ago` matches everything from the start of that day.

With no message matching, `count` is `0` and `all` is empty.

### `list` - List Mailboxes

List available mailboxes.

```yaml
- name: "list"
  reference: ""         # Optional: reference name
  pattern: "*"          # Optional: mailbox pattern (default: "*")
- name: "list"
  reference: "INBOX"
  pattern: "INBOX/*"
```

### `fetch` and `uid fetch` - Fetch Message Data

Retrieve messages by sequence number, or by UID with `uid fetch`. Without `sequence`, they fetch the messages the latest search found, provided it was the matching kind: `search` for `fetch`, `uid search` for `uid fetch`. `fetch` needs `dataitem`; `uid fetch` fetches `ALL` without it. Both put the messages in `res.data.fetch`.

```yaml
- name: "fetch"
  sequence: "1:5"       # Sequence range; the last search result if omitted
  dataitem: "ALL"       # Data items to fetch
- name: "fetch"
  sequence: "*"         # Latest message
  dataitem: "ENVELOPE FLAGS"
- name: "uid search"
  criteria:
    not_flags: ["seen"]
- name: "uid fetch"     # The UIDs just found, with ALL
```

`dataitem` is one of the macros `ALL`, `FAST` and `FULL`, or a space-separated list of `ENVELOPE`, `FLAGS`, `INTERNALDATE`, `RFC822.SIZE`, `UID`, `BODYSTRUCTURE` and `BODY[...]` or `BODY.PEEK[...]` sections. `ENVELOPE` fills `from`, `to` and `subject`; `RFC822.SIZE` fills `size`. A section fills these fields of the message:

| Section | Fills |
|---------|-------|
| `BODY[]` | `body` with the whole message, headers included |
| `BODY[TEXT]` | `body` with the body only |
| `BODY[HEADER]` | `headers` with every header field |
| `BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (SUBJECT FROM)]` | `headers` with the listed fields |

`BODY[...]` marks the messages read; `BODY.PEEK[...]` leaves their flags alone. Header names in `headers` are lower case, as in `headers.subject`. A body containing `<html` is also put in `html_body`.

### `create`, `delete`, `rename`, `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` - Manage Mailboxes

Create a mailbox, delete one, rename one, or add one to or remove it from the subscribed mailboxes. `rename` takes the current name in `oldmailbox` and the new one in `newmailbox`; the others take `mailbox`. A missing name fails the command.

```yaml
- name: "create"
  mailbox: "Work"
- name: "rename"
  oldmailbox: "Work"
  newmailbox: "Projects"
- name: "subscribe"
  mailbox: "Projects"
- name: "unsubscribe"
  mailbox: "Projects"
- name: "delete"
  mailbox: "Projects"
```

### `noop` - Do Nothing

Ask the server for nothing. It checks that the session is still alive, and lets the server report changes to the selected mailbox.

```yaml
- name: "noop"
```

### `store` and `uid store` - Change Flags

Set, add or remove flags on messages. `dataitem` is `FLAGS` to replace the flags, `+FLAGS` to add, or `-FLAGS` to remove, optionally followed by `.SILENT` so the server does not send the new flags back. `value` lists the flags, with or without parentheses; an empty value or `()` with `FLAGS` clears every flag, and a lone parenthesis is refused. `uid store` takes UIDs in `sequence`. Without `sequence`, both act on the messages the latest search found, as `fetch` does, provided it was the matching kind: `search` for `store`, `uid search` for `uid store`. Each search replaces the previous one of either kind, so an older search is never used.

In `sequence`, a lone `*` is the last message, and every number has to be from `1` to `4294967295`; `0` or a larger value is refused rather than read as `*`. A `select` or `examine` forgets the last search result, since numbers belong to one mailbox, so a command without `sequence` after switching mailboxes fails instead of acting on the wrong messages.

```yaml
- name: "select"
  mailbox: "INBOX"
- name: "store"
  sequence: "1:3"
  dataitem: "+FLAGS"
  value: '\Seen \Flagged'
```

`res.data.store.count` is the number of messages the server reported with their new flags, which is `0` with `.SILENT`. Only flags can be stored; another data item fails the command.

### `copy` and `uid copy` - Copy Messages

Copy messages into another mailbox, which has to exist. `uid copy` takes UIDs in `sequence`, and without `sequence` both act on the last search result.

```yaml
- name: "select"
  mailbox: "INBOX"
- name: "copy"
  sequence: "1:2"
  mailbox: "Archive"
```

`res.data.copy.count` is the number of messages copied when the server reports it, which it does when it supports UIDPLUS; otherwise it is `0`.

A command that fails, such as a `copy` into a mailbox that does not exist, sets `res.code` to `1` and puts the reason in `res.error`, as every IMAP command does.

## Response Object

The IMAP action provides a `res` object with the following structure:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `code` | Integer | `0` when every command succeeded, `1` when a command failed, `2` when every command succeeded but logging out failed |
| `data` | Object | Command results organized by command type |
| `error` | String | Error message if operation failed |

The top-level `status` is the same as `res.code`, and `rt.duration` (such as `"12ms"`) and `rt.sec` give how long the whole session took, from connecting to logging out. A connection, login or timeout failure is not a `res.code`: it fails the step as an action error.

`res.data` has one entry per command, named after it. A command that did not run leaves its entry at zero values. `uid search`, `uid fetch`, `uid store` and `uid copy` share the entry of the command without `uid`.

| Entry | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| `select`, `examine` | `exists` (messages in the mailbox), `recent`, `first_unseen` (sequence number of the first unread message, `0` if the server does not say), `uid_next`, `flags`, `permanent_flags` |
| `search` | `all` (the matching numbers as a set, such as `2:3`), `min`, `max`, `count` |
| `list` | `mailboxes` (each with `name`, `attributes` and `delimiter`), `count` |
| `fetch` | `messages`, `count` |
| `store`, `copy` | `success`, `count` |
| `create`, `delete`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe` | `success`, `mailbox` |
| `rename` | `success`, `old_mailbox`, `new_mailbox` |
| `noop` | `success` |

Each entry of `res.data.fetch.messages` has `uid`, `flags`, `date`, `from`, `to`, `subject`, `size`, `body`, `html_body` and `headers`, filled as the data items asked for. `date` is the envelope's `Date` in RFC 3339, such as `2025-10-08T07:11:55Z`, and is empty when the message has none. `from` and `to` are the first address only. Index the list to reach a message, as in `res.data.fetch.messages[0].from`.

## IMAP Examples

Providers differ in port, TLS and credentials. The example below is a working configuration for Gmail.

### Gmail Configuration

Gmail requires an app password rather than the account password, and TLS on port 993.

```yaml
vars:
  gmail_username: "{{GMAIL_USERNAME}}"
  gmail_app_password: "{{GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD}}"

steps:
  - name: "Check Gmail Inbox"
    uses: imap
    with:
      host: "imap.gmail.com"
      port: 993
      username: "{{vars.gmail_username}}"
      password: "{{vars.gmail_app_password}}"  # Use App Password
      tls: true
      commands:
      - name: "select"
        mailbox: "INBOX"
      - name: "search"
        criteria:
          not_flags: ["seen"]
          since: "today"
      - name: "fetch"
        sequence: "*"
        dataitem: "ENVELOPE FLAGS"
    test: res.code == 0
    outputs:
      unread_count: res.data.search.count
      latest_sender: res.data.fetch.messages[0].from
```
