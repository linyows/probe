# SMTP Action

The `smtp` action delivers mail to an SMTP server. It is built for measuring and exercising delivery rather than for sending hand-written notifications: the message body is generated, and its size is set with `length`.

## Basic Syntax

An SMTP step names the server, the envelope addresses, and what to send.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Send a probe mail
    uses: smtp
    with:
      addr: "localhost:2525"
      from: "sender@example.com"
      to: "recipient@example.com"
      subject: "Delivery probe"
      session: 1
      message: 1
      length: 500
    test: res.code == 0 && res.sent > 0
```

## Parameters

The fields below describe the delivery. All of them accept template expressions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `addr` | String | Yes | - | SMTP server as `host:port` |
| `from` | String | Yes | - | Envelope sender |
| `to` | String | Yes | - | Envelope recipient. Several recipients are separated by commas without spaces, such as `a@example.com,b@example.com` |
| `subject` | String | No | `""` | Subject line |
| `myhostname` | String | No | The machine's host name, or `localhost` if it is unknown | Hostname sent in the `EHLO` / `HELO` command. Many servers refuse a client that greets with `localhost`, so set a name the server accepts |
| `session` | Integer | No | `1` | Number of SMTP sessions to open at the same time |
| `message` | Integer | No | `1` | Messages to send in total, divided among the sessions |
| `length` | Integer | No | `0` | Number of `*` characters appended to the generated body |

There are no parameters for authentication, TLS, CC/BCC, a custom body or HTML. To include a report in the run output, use the step's `echo`.

The generated message has `From`, `To`, `Date` and `Subject` headers and a body of `This is a test mail.` followed by `length` `*` characters, broken into lines of 80.

## Response Object

After the step, `res` reports how much was delivered.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `res.code` | Integer | `0` when no session failed and at least one message was delivered |
| `res.sent` | Integer | Messages delivered |
| `res.failed` | Integer | Sessions that failed. A session that fails delivers none of its messages |
| `res.total` | Integer | Messages attempted |
| `res.error` | String | Error message, when delivery failed |
| `res.maildata` | String | The generated message, when it is text |
| `res.filepath` | String | Path to the generated message, when it is binary |
| `rt.duration` | String | Time the delivery took, such as `"3.4ms"` |
| `rt.sec` | Float | Time the delivery took in seconds |
| `status` | Integer | Same as `res.code` |

## SMTP Examples

The examples below send generated messages and then read the counts back from the step outputs.

### Several Sessions and Messages

`message` is the total, divided among the sessions: here one session delivers 2 messages and the other 1.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deliver 3 messages over 2 sessions
    id: bulk
    uses: smtp
    with:
      addr: "{{vars.smtp_addr}}"
      from: "{{vars.from_addr}}"
      to: "{{vars.to_addr}}"
      subject: "Bulk delivery test"
      myhostname: probe-client.local
      session: 2
      message: 3
      length: 750
    test: res.code == 0 && res.sent == 3
    outputs:
      sent: res.sent
      elapsed: rt.duration
```

### Reporting the Result

The counts captured as outputs can be printed by a later step.

```yaml
  - name: Delivery summary
    uses: hello
    echo: |
      Sent: {{outputs.bulk.sent}}
      Took: {{outputs.bulk.elapsed}}
```
