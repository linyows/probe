# GraphQL Action

The GraphQL action sends a GraphQL query or mutation over HTTP and returns the `data` and `errors` of the response apart.

It is an [external action](/guide/concepts/actions#external-actions), published in [mozership/probe-graphql](https://github.com/mozership/probe-graphql). Probe downloads it the first time a workflow uses it, and runs the executable whose SHA-256 the `action.yml` at the pinned commit names. It needs Probe v1.17.0 or later.

## Basic Syntax

A step pins the action by a full commit SHA. The notes of each [release](https://github.com/mozership/probe-graphql/releases) start with the `uses` line to copy.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Look up Japan
    uses: github.com/mozership/probe-graphql@f9e7b841b87dccbcbe71ae10f8562aa637d52a51 # v0.1.0
    with:
      url: https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
      query: |
        query Country($code: ID!) {
          country(code: $code) { name capital currency }
        }
      variables:
        code: JP
    test: res.code == 200 && len(res.errors) == 0 && res.data.country.capital == "Tokyo"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `url` | String | Yes | - | GraphQL endpoint, `http` or `https` |
| `query` | String | Yes | - | The query or mutation document |
| `variables` | Object | No | - | Values for the variables the document declares |
| `operation_name` | String | No | - | The operation to run when the document has more than one |
| `headers` | Object | No | - | Request headers, such as `Authorization`. They override the defaults below |
| `timeout` | Duration | No | `30s` | Time limit for the request, as `10s` or a number of seconds. `0` removes it |

The request is a `POST` with a JSON body, sent with `Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/graphql-response+json, application/json` and `User-Agent: probe-graphql/<version>`.

## Response Object

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `res.code` | Integer | HTTP status code |
| `res.status` | String | HTTP status line, such as `"200 OK"` |
| `res.headers` | Object | Response headers, keyed by canonical name |
| `res.data` | Any | The `data` of the response, or `null` |
| `res.errors` | Array | The `errors` of the response; empty when there are none |
| `res.body` | Any | The whole response body, parsed when it is JSON, otherwise the raw string |
| `res.rawbody` | String | The unparsed body, present when the body is JSON |
| `req` | Object | The `url`, `query`, `variables`, `operation_name` and `headers` that were sent |
| `rt` | Duration | Round-trip time |
| `status` | Integer | `0` when the status code is 2xx, the body is JSON and `errors` is empty; `1` otherwise |

Any response the server sends is a result, so a test can assert on a GraphQL error or a 500. Only a request that gets no response, such as a refused connection or a timeout, fails the step as an error.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: An unknown field is reported in res.errors
    uses: github.com/mozership/probe-graphql@f9e7b841b87dccbcbe71ae10f8562aa637d52a51 # v0.1.0
    with:
      url: https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
      query: '{ country(code: "JP") { nope } }'
    test: status == 1 && len(res.errors) > 0
```

The action does not keep to `--read-only` or `--allow-host`. Under either, a step that uses it is refused unless `--allow-action` names it.
