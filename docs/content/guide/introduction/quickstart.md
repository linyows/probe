# Quickstart

This guide will get you up and running with Probe in just a few minutes. You'll create your first workflow and see Probe in action.

## Prerequisites

- [Probe installed](/guide/introduction/installation) on your system
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax

## Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow that checks if a website is responding correctly.

### 1. Create a Workflow File

Create a new file called `my-first-workflow.yml`:

```yaml
name: My First Website Check
description: Check if my website is responding correctly

jobs:
- id: health-check
  name: Website Health Check
  steps:
    - name: Check Homepage
      uses: http
      with:
        url: https://httpbin.org/status/200
        method: GET
      test: res.code == 200
        
    - name: Check API Endpoint
      uses: http
      with:
        url: https://httpbin.org/json
        method: GET
      test: res.code == 200 && res.body.slideshow != null
        
    - name: Success Message
      uses: hello
      echo: "✅ All checks passed! Website is healthy."
```

### 2. Run Your Workflow

Execute the workflow using the Probe CLI:

```bash
probe my-first-workflow.yml
```

You should see output similar to:

```
My First Website Check
Check if my website is responding correctly

⏺ Website Health Check (Completed in 1.23s)
  ⎿ 0. ✔︎  Check Homepage (245ms)
     1. ✔︎  Check API Endpoint (189ms)
     2. ✔︎  Success Message
       ✅ All checks passed! Website is healthy.

Total workflow time: 1.23s ✔︎ All jobs succeeded
```

### 3. Understanding What Happened

Let's break down what this workflow does:

1. **Workflow Metadata**: The `name` and `description` provide context about what this workflow does
2. **Job Definition**: The `health-check` job contains the steps to execute
3. **HTTP Actions**: Two steps make HTTP requests to test endpoints
4. **Test Assertions**: Each HTTP step includes a `test` that validates the response
5. **Echo Step**: Displays a success message when all checks pass

## Adding Verbose Output

Want to see more details about what's happening? Run with the verbose flag:

```bash
probe -v my-first-workflow.yml
```

This will show detailed information about each HTTP request and response.

## What's Next?

Now that you've run your first workflow, you can:

1. **[Learn the core concepts](/guide/introduction/understanding-probe)** - Understand workflows, jobs, and steps
2. **[Create your first custom workflow](/guide/introduction/your-first-workflow)** - Build something tailored to your needs
3. **[Explore CLI options](/guide/introduction/cli-basics)** - Learn about all available command-line options

## Common Next Steps

Two changes cover most of what a first workflow grows into: running against more than one environment, and deciding what happens when a check fails.

### Check Multiple Environments

Modify your workflow to check different environments:

```yaml
name: Multi-Environment Health Check
description: Check health across multiple environments

jobs:
- id: production-check
  name: Production Health Check
  steps:
    - name: Check Production API
      uses: http
      with:
        url: https://api.myapp.com/health
        method: GET
      test: res.code == 200

- id: staging-check
  name: Staging Health Check
  steps:
    - name: Check Staging API
      uses: http
      with:
        url: https://staging-api.myapp.com/health
        method: GET
      test: res.code == 200
```

### Add Error Handling

Include steps that handle failures gracefully:

```yaml
- name: Check Service
  uses: http
  with:
    url: https://api.example.com/status
    method: GET
  test: res.code == 200
  
- name: Fallback Check
  uses: http
  with:
    url: https://backup-api.example.com/status
    method: GET
  test: res.code == 200
```

## Troubleshooting

Three things account for nearly every failure on a first run.

### Workflow File Not Found

The path given does not point at a file.

```
[ERROR] workflow is required
```

Make sure you're providing the correct path to your YAML file.

### Invalid YAML Syntax

The file was found but could not be parsed.

```
[ERROR] yaml: line 5: mapping values are not allowed in this context
```

Check your YAML syntax. Common issues include:
- Incorrect indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
- Missing colons after keys
- Unquoted strings with special characters

### Test Failures

If your tests fail, use verbose mode (`-v`) to see the actual response data and debug your test expressions.
