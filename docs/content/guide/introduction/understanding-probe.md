# Understanding Probe

Probe is a YAML-based workflow automation tool designed for monitoring, testing, and automation tasks. This guide explains the core concepts you need to understand to effectively use Probe.

## Core Concepts

Probe has four building blocks. A workflow contains jobs, a job contains steps, and a step invokes an action.

### Workflows

A **workflow** is the top-level container that defines what Probe should execute. It consists of:

- **Metadata**: Name and description of the workflow
- **Jobs**: One or more jobs that can run in parallel or sequentially
- **Global configuration**: Shared settings that apply to all jobs

```yaml
name: My Workflow
description: What this workflow does
# Jobs go here...
```

### Jobs

A **job** is a collection of steps that execute together. Jobs can:

- Run in parallel with other jobs
- Have dependencies on other jobs
- Share outputs with other jobs
- Have their own configuration and context

```yaml
jobs:
- id: job-name
  name: Human-readable job name
  needs: [other-job]  # Optional: wait for other jobs
  steps:
    # Steps go here...
```

### Steps

A **step** is the smallest unit of execution. Each step can:

- Execute an action (HTTP request, email, etc.)
- Run tests to validate results
- Echo messages to the output
- Set outputs for use by other steps
- Have conditional execution logic

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Step Name
    action: http          # The action to execute
    with:                 # Parameters for the action
      url: https://api.example.com
      method: GET
    test: res.code == 200  # Test condition
    outputs:              # Data to pass to other steps
      response_time: (rt.sec * 1000)
```

### Actions

**Actions** are the building blocks that actually do the work. Probe comes with built-in actions:

- **`http`**: Make HTTP/HTTPS requests
- **`shell`**: Execute shell commands and scripts securely
- **`smtp`**: Send email notifications and alerts
- **`hello`**: Simple greeting action (mainly for testing)

Actions are implemented as plugins, so you can extend Probe with custom actions.

## Workflow Execution Model

Jobs run at the same time unless a dependency says otherwise, and the data one job produces is what the next one reads.

### Parallel Execution

By default, jobs run in parallel for maximum efficiency:

```yaml
jobs:
- id: frontend-check
  name: frontend-check
  # ...             # at the same time
- id: backend-check
  name: backend-check
  # ...
- id: database-check
  name: database-check
  # ...
```

### Sequential Execution with Dependencies

Use the `needs` keyword to create dependencies:

```yaml
jobs:
- id: setup
  name: Setup Environment
  steps:
    # Setup steps...

- id: test
  name: Run Tests
  needs: [setup]     # Wait for 'setup' to complete
  steps:
    # Test steps...

- id: cleanup
  name: Clean Up
  needs: [test]      # Wait for 'test' to complete
  steps:
    # Cleanup steps...
```

### Data Flow

Data flows through the workflow using **outputs**:

```yaml
jobs:
- id: data-fetch
  name: data-fetch
  steps:
    - name: Get User Info
      id: data-fetch
      uses: http
      with:
        method: GET
        url: https://api.example.com/user/123
      outputs:
        user_id: res.body.id
        user_name: res.body.name

- id: notification
  name: notification
  needs: [data-fetch]
  steps:
    - name: Send Welcome Email
      uses: hello
      echo: "Welcome {{outputs['data-fetch'].user_name}}!"
```

## Expression System

Probe uses expressions for dynamic values and testing. Expressions are written using `{{}}` syntax:

### Template Expressions

Use template expressions to insert dynamic values:

```yaml
- name: Greet User
  echo: "Hello {{outputs['previous-step'].username}}!"
```

### Test Expressions

Use test expressions to validate results:

```yaml
- name: Check API Response
  uses: http
  with:
    method: GET
    url: https://api.example.com/status
  test: res.code == 200 && res.body.healthy == true
```

### Available Variables

In expressions, you have access to:

- **`res`**: Response from the current action
- **`outputs`**: Outputs from previous steps/jobs
- **`env`**: Environment variables
- **Custom functions**: `random_int()`, `random_str()`, `unixtime()`

## File Merging

Probe supports merging multiple YAML files, which is useful for:

- Separating configuration from workflow logic
- Reusing common definitions across workflows
- Environment-specific overrides

```bash
# Merge base workflow with environment-specific config
probe base-workflow.yml,production-config.yml
```

The files are merged in order, with later files overriding values from earlier files.

## Error Handling

Probe provides several mechanisms for handling errors:

### Test Failures

When a test fails, the step is marked as failed:

```yaml
- name: Critical Check
  uses: http
  with:
    method: GET
    url: https://critical-api.example.com
  test: res.code == 200  # If this fails, step fails
```

### Conditional Execution

Use `skipif` to skip a step. The expression sees the outputs of earlier steps, so publish what the decision depends on rather than asserting it with `test`.

```yaml
- name: Primary Service Check
  id: primary
  uses: http
  with:
    method: GET
    url: https://primary-api.example.com
  outputs:
    primary_ok: res.code == 200

- name: Fallback Check
  uses: http
  skipif: outputs.primary.primary_ok
  with:
    method: GET
    url: https://backup-api.example.com
  test: res.code == 200
```


### When a Step Fails

A failing `test` marks the step and its job as failed, but the remaining steps of that job still run. Jobs that declare the failed job in `needs` are skipped, and the workflow exits with status `1`.

There is no per-step or per-job switch to ignore a failure. If a check is not meant to fail the workflow, publish its result as an output instead of asserting it:

```yaml
- name: Optional Service Check
  id: optional
  uses: http
  with:
    method: GET
    url: https://optional-service.example.com
  outputs:
    optional_ok: res.code == 200
```


## Best Practices

The points below cover naming, how steps are grouped, how data is passed, and what the tests assert.

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

Names appear in the report, so they are what a failure is read by.

```yaml
# Good
- name: Check Production API Health
  uses: http
  # ...

# Not so good  
- name: HTTP Check
  uses: http
  # ...
```

### 2. Group Related Steps into Jobs

Steps that share a subject belong in one job, because that is the unit that runs in order and fails together.

```yaml
jobs:
- id: infrastructure-check
  name: Infrastructure Health Check
  steps:
    - name: Check Database
      # ...
    - name: Check Cache
      # ...
    - name: Check Load Balancer
      # ...
```

### 3. Use Outputs for Data Sharing

A value needed later is published as an output rather than fetched again.

```yaml
- name: Fetch Configuration
  id: config
  uses: http
  with:
    method: GET
    url: https://config-service.example.com
  outputs:
    database_url: res.body.database_url
    
- name: Test Database Connection
  uses: http
  with:
    method: GET
    url: "{{outputs.config.database_url}}/health"
```

### 4. Add Meaningful Test Conditions

A test should assert what the step was for, not merely that a response arrived.

```yaml
# Good - specific test conditions
test: res.code == 200 && res.body.status == "healthy" && (rt.sec * 1000) < 1000

# Not so good - generic test
test: res.code == 200
```
