# Tutorials

This section provides comprehensive, step-by-step tutorials that guide you through real-world use cases and advanced Probe implementations. Each tutorial builds on practical scenarios you'll encounter when monitoring and testing your systems.

## Getting Started Tutorials

- **[Building Your First Monitoring System](first-monitoring-system/)** - Create a complete monitoring workflow from scratch
- **[API Testing Pipeline](api-testing-pipeline/)** - Build a comprehensive API testing suite
- **[Multi-Environment Deployment Testing](multi-environment-testing/)** - Test across development, staging, and production

## Available How-to Guides

For specific implementation patterns, check out our [How-to Guides](../how-tos/):

- **[Monitoring Workflows](../how-tos/monitoring-workflows/)** - Build comprehensive monitoring systems
- **[API Testing](../how-tos/api-testing/)** - Advanced API testing strategies
- **[Performance Testing](../how-tos/performance-testing/)** - Load testing and performance validation
- **[Error Handling Strategies](../how-tos/error-handling-strategies/)** - Robust error handling patterns
- **[Environment Management](../how-tos/environment-management/)** - Manage configurations across environments

## What You'll Learn

Each tutorial is designed to teach you:

- **Practical implementation patterns** that solve real problems
- **Best practices** for workflow organization and maintenance
- **Integration techniques** with popular tools and platforms
- **Troubleshooting skills** for common issues
- **Performance optimization** strategies

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows a consistent structure:

1. **Problem Overview** - What you'll solve and why it matters
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
3. **Step-by-Step Implementation** - Detailed instructions with code examples
4. **Testing and Validation** - How to verify your implementation works
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Next Steps** - How to extend and improve your implementation

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should have:

- Probe installed on your system ([Installation Guide](../get-started/installation/))
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax
- Familiarity with REST APIs and HTTP
- Access to the systems you want to monitor

## Choose Your Path

**New to monitoring?** Start with [Building Your First Monitoring System](first-monitoring-system/) to learn the fundamentals.

**Testing APIs?** Jump to [API Testing Pipeline](api-testing-pipeline/) for comprehensive API validation techniques.
