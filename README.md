Write a workflow across HTTP, gRPC, databases, mail, SSH and shell in readable YAML, and Probe runs its jobs in parallel; a new protocol can be added as an action. Probe is a single binary that runs the same on your machine, in CI and from cron, with the result in its exit status. A workflow an AI coding agent wrote can be checked before it runs, and run without the writes and connections you did not allow. Documentation: [probe.linyo.ws](https://probe.linyo.ws/)

Features
--------

Probe was made for reproducible experiments in computer science: a workflow that drives many protocols is written down in YAML, short enough to read, and run again the same way. The same workflows serve as end-to-end tests that keep software reliable, which matters more now that AI agents, not people, write much of the code.

- **Flexible.** HTTP, gRPC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SMTP, IMAP, SSH and shell are built in, external actions add a browser, GraphQL and JMAP, and a new protocol can be added as an action of its own. Jobs run in parallel unless `needs` orders them, so one run can call an endpoint, query the row it wrote and read the mail it sent, and `repeat` runs the same workflow on an interval as a monitor.
- **Easy to run and keep.** A workflow is YAML you can read, and steps several scenarios share, such as a login, live in one job file that `uses: embedded` runs. Probe is a single binary with nothing to install alongside it, so it runs the same on your machine, in CI and from cron, and `probe dag` prints the jobs as a flowchart in ASCII or Mermaid.
- **Ready for AI coding agents.** `probe skill` teaches an agent to write workflows for the version installed, and `probe check` finds its mistakes before anything runs. `--read-only` and `--allow-host` refuse writes, and connections to hosts you did not list, before they are sent, so a workflow the agent wrote can be run safely. A step can also check responses against your OpenAPI document or `.proto` files, not only against the agent's own `test`.

Beyond that, a workflow has `outputs` to pass data between steps and jobs, `test` to assert on any response, `retry`, `skipif`, `iteration`, `wait` and `timeout`, `defaults` for settings shared across steps, and merging of several YAML files on one command line.

[Understanding Probe](https://probe.linyo.ws/guide/introduction/understanding-probe) covers how these fit together, and [Comparison](https://probe.linyo.ws/guide/introduction/comparison) says where k6, Hurl, Venom, runn, Blackbox exporter or GitHub Actions is the better answer.

Quick Start
-----------

Install the binary:

```bash
go install github.com/linyows/probe/cmd/probe@latest
```

Write a workflow:

```yaml
# health-check.yml
name: API Health Check
jobs:
- name: Check API Status
  steps:
  - name: Ping API
    uses: http
    with:
      url: https://api.example.com
      get: /health
    test: res.code == 200
```

Run it:

```bash
probe health-check.yml
```

```
API Health Check

⏺ Check API Status (Completed in 0.02s)
  ⎿ 0. ✓  Ping API

Total workflow time: 0.02s ✓ All jobs succeeded
```

[Quickstart](https://probe.linyo.ws/guide/introduction/quickstart) goes through this step by step, and [Your First Workflow](https://probe.linyo.ws/guide/introduction/your-first-workflow) grows it into something you can leave running.

Built-in Actions
----------------

| Action | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [`http`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/http) | HTTP requests and their responses |
| [`db`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/db) | Queries against MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite |
| [`smtp`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/smtp) | Delivering mail |
| [`imap`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/imap) | Reading a mailbox |
| [`ssh`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/ssh) | Commands on a remote host |
| [`shell`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/shell) | Commands on the machine running Probe |
| [`grpc`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/grpc) | gRPC and Connect calls, streaming included |
| [`embedded`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/embedded) | Running another job file from a step |
| [`hello`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/hello) | Printing a report line |

These are external actions, each in a repository of its own, which a step pins by commit:

| Action | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [browser](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/browser) | Driving a real browser |
| [graphql](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/graphql) | GraphQL queries over HTTP |
| [jmap](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/jmap) | JMAP methods |
| [mail-latency](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/actions/mail-latency) | Measuring delivery latency from received messages |
